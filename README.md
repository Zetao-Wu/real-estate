## Real-Estate App

Developed a full-stack real-estate application using the MERN stack, implementing key features such as advanced user authentication using JWT and dynamic image uploading along with Google OAuth through Firebase.
Created RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on property listings, integrated with client-side components using React Hooks, React Redux for state management, and Swiper.js for interactive image galleries.
